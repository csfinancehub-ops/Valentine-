  <h1>For Linsu</h1>
  <p>This website is just one of the thousand stars in the universe to show how much I love you.</p>

  <h2>How It All Started</h2>
  <p>
    People might think it all started when I first approached you, or when we held hands in the train just because of the crowd.  
    Or maybe when we ran from our friends to catch an early train, standing near the door, blushing, flirting, and smiling nonstop on that 5:30 local from Vashi to Panvel.  
    Yes, that moment was magical.  
    <br><br>
    But for me, it started much earlier.  
    It started the moment I saw you in our class.  
    I don’t believe in love at first sight, but I knew one thing — you were going to mean something to me someday.  
    And today, celebrating our second Valentine together, I couldn’t be happier.

  <h2>The Moment I Fell</h2>
  <p>
    There were many moments when I fell for you, but the one where I fell the hardest was that day you walked into class.  
    Everything went silent for me. My eyes saw only you.  
    You were wearing a kurta, and even though we weren’t close, I wanted to tell you how beautiful you looked.  
    That was the day I fell — and I fell hard.
  </p>

<section class="section">
  <h2>What I Love About You</h2>
  <p>
    What I love about you is not one thing — it’s everything.  
    Your kindness, the person you are.  
    But if I had to choose one thing, it would be your eyes.  
    I can’t stop looking at them, and I never want to.

  <p>
    These photos mean comfort, fun, safety, madness, and peace.  
    With you, time slows down, the world fades away, and even silence feels full.  
    Somewhere between laughter and chaos, you became my home.

  <h2>My Letter to You</h2>
  <p class="address">To Linsu<br>Address: In Sahil’s heart</p>
  <p><strong>Subject:</strong> The Red String, The Moon, and The Air</p>

  <p>
    There is a story of a red string tied to two souls destined to meet.  
    I believe we have that string — now, tomorrow, and forever.
    <br><br>
    The moon reminds me that even when we are apart, we are still connected.  
    And the air reminds me that love doesn’t need to be seen — only felt.
    <br><br>
    This is what you mean to me.  
    This is what we mean to me.
  </p>

  <p class="sign">Always,<br>Sahil</p>
